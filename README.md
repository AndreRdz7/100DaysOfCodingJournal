# 100DaysOfCodeJournal

In this repository I will document the progress, results and outputs of this challenge I'm making.  
My minimum goal is to finish the challenge without skipping a day and the upgrade it to 365 days of code.  
Documented thing will be a wide range of activities, including but not limited to reading, tutorials,
university assingments, side projects, work, problem solving, research and everything related to coding I do.
