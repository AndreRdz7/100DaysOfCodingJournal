# 100DaysOfCodeJournal

In this repository I will document the progress, results and outputs of this challenge I'm making.  
My minimum goal is to finish the challenge without skipping a day and the upgrade it to 365 days of code.  
Documented thing will be a wide range of activities, including but not limited to reading, tutorials,
university assingments, side projects, work, problem solving, research and everything related to coding I do.

## Day 1, Jan 1st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: pointer's declaration, access, storage, dereference, arithmetic, also dynamic memory allocation and  
passing pointers to functions, returning pointers from functions, references, L and R-values in C++.  
Gulp JS crash course including moving and copying files, concatenating files, minify (uglyfy) files, and optimize images.

**Thoughts**: I've been learnign C++ lately and it feels so powerful, yet, kinda simple to use, since I really learned how to code in C, it feels
quite familiar, however there are some importante differences I will encounter lately. Pointers look really low level, since it's kind of interacting
with hardware, it gives me the sensation of power and control of what I want to do, it's really interesting. Gulp is a handy tool, a nice understanding
of what I can do to enhance workflows, I don't it's a _MUST_ in the knowledge baggage, but sure it won't hurt to learn a little bit deeper.

## Day 2, Jan 2nd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: OOP in C++: classes, constructors, initialization list, delegation of constructors, copy constructors, class member manipulation, shallow vs deep copying, move constructors with l-value and r-value parameters, public vs private, methods, destructors, friends of class, static classes, 'this' pointer. LeetCoded in the Microsoft Top Questions, solving 4 problems in Arrays and Strings cathegory (since it's a paid feature of LeetCode, I cannot provide further details on the problem's number or description).

**Thoughts**: I learnt about OOP about 2.5 years ago, coded in Java, and I was somewhat familiar with OOP in C++ since I was familiar with C structs and
OOP overall, I think it's always good to reinforce the foundations of coding once in a while, and since I will be using Unreal Engine soon to do a guided
videogame, an OOP "crash course" comes in handy. After OOP there are 4 topics left, smart pointers, error handling, streams and STL; I'm really excited about the STL section, It will benefit me a lot for problem solving.

## Day 3, Jan 3rd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to GraphQL, querying, nested querying, babel setup for projects, ES6 import/export and a small API example of a query returning a simple string.

**Thoughts**: A little break from C++ as I don't want to overload me with a specific topic, since I've been done waaay more than an hour on the challenge, so the next topic I'm into (besides AI/ML wich I will start on Monday 6) is GraphQL, in my past job I worked with it by doing queries, mutations and subscriptions, but now I'm looking for knowledge in design and creation of GQL APis. I kinda have a previous experience _doing_ GQL, I did it with Absinthe for an Elixir backend, but it was kind of a mess and It didn't workout properly.
