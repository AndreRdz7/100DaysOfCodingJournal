# 100DaysOfCodeJournal

In this repository I will document the progress, results and outputs of this challenge I'm making.  
My minimum goal is to finish the challenge without skipping a day and then, upgrade it to 365 days of code.  
I will document a wide range of activities, including but not limited to reading, tutorials, lessons, 
university assingments, side projects, work, problem solving, research and everything related to coding/programming I do.
I'm tempted to include the Euler project challenge within this.

## Day 1, Jan 1st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: pointer's declaration, access, storage, dereference, arithmetic, also dynamic memory allocation and  
passing pointers to functions, returning pointers from functions, references, L and R-values in C++.  
Gulp JS crash course including moving and copying files, concatenating files, minify (uglyfy) files, and optimize images.

**Thoughts**: I've been learnign C++ lately and it feels so powerful, yet, kinda simple to use, since I really learned how to code in C, it feels
quite familiar, however there are some importante differences I will encounter lately. Pointers look really low level, since it's kind of interacting
with hardware, it gives me the sensation of power and control of what I want to do, it's really interesting. Gulp is a handy tool, a nice understanding
of what I can do to enhance workflows, I don't it's a _MUST_ in the knowledge baggage, but sure it won't hurt to learn a little bit deeper.

## Day 2, Jan 2nd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: OOP in C++: classes, constructors, initialization list, delegation of constructors, copy constructors, class member manipulation, shallow vs deep copying, move constructors with l-value and r-value parameters, public vs private, methods, destructors, friends of class, static classes, 'this' pointer. LeetCoded in the Microsoft Top Questions, solving 4 problems in Arrays and Strings cathegory (since it's a paid feature of LeetCode, I cannot provide further details on the problem's number or description).

**Thoughts**: I learnt about OOP about 2.5 years ago, coded in Java, and I was somewhat familiar with OOP in C++ since I was familiar with C structs and
OOP overall, I think it's always good to reinforce the foundations of coding once in a while, and since I will be using Unreal Engine soon to do a guided
videogame, an OOP "crash course" comes in handy. After OOP there are 4 topics left, smart pointers, error handling, streams and STL; I'm really excited about the STL section, It will benefit me a lot for problem solving.

## Day 3, Jan 3rd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to GraphQL, querying, nested querying, babel setup for projects, ES6 import/export and a small API example of a query returning a simple string.

**Thoughts**: A little break from C++ as I don't want to overload me with a specific topic, since I've been done waaay more than an hour on the challenge, so the next topic I'm into (besides AI/ML wich I will start on Monday 6) is GraphQL, in my past job I worked with it by doing queries, mutations and subscriptions, but now I'm looking for knowledge in design and creation of GQL APis. I kinda have a previous experience _doing_ GQL, I did it with Absinthe for an Elixir backend, but it was kind of a mess and It didn't workout properly.

## Day 4, Jan 4th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Data types on GQL, custom types (class like), operation arguments, array manipulation, simple relational data and by arrays.

**Thoughts**: Imagine the data as a graph is much more simpler than thought at first glance, we can even think of it as a "relational database" that can be cyclical and can access a lot of information as long as it's related without thinking about all inner joins of tables, and where clauses on queries etc. I think GQL is truly the future of APIs, I don't think it will be the norm for this year, but I have a gut feeling that most small companies and even large companies will start to create and/or migrate their apis to GQL, since these API's can be accesed with a client like Altair (on browser) or Postman.

## Day 5, Jan 5th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. operations) in GQL, custom defined input types for mutations leading to a better and more undestandable code, babel configuration of plugins.

**Thoughts**: Been familiar with mutations in graphql only on the frontend, on the backend it looks way more interesting and I think this part is another example of the power of GQL and why it's the future. Tomorrow I will start to add Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and Data Science to this challenge.

## Day 6, Jan 6th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Started a new journey in the world of research, I enrolled in a _R&D_ career path on my university, where I will work with profesors all around the world to perform research and develop new, innovative and open source projects, I'm starting to familiarize with the project, _grosso modo_ it consist of Business Process Simulations with automatization and enhancement of parameters in orden to obtain the most realistic simulation possible with the given data logs. I will be working with Python and Jupyter notebooks in the future of this project. Re-started my AI journey with Q-Learning, getting the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, the Bellman equation and Markov decision processes, I have 3 papers to read to go deeper and fully understand the concepts, I will read them tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: This research "course" looks very interesting and very promising, I will be working with at least 3 PhD professors and I finally will be involved on this career path that I've been dreaming on.

## Day 7, Jan 7th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Read 'Reinforcement Learning I: Introduction' from Richard Sutton ad Andrew Barto; onto AI, the policy vs plan of reinforcement learning, the 'living penalty', full Q-learning intuition and the temporal difference. Added 2 papers to my to read list.

**Thoughts**: I honestly was expecting a lot more from Hadelin de Ponteves and Kiril Eremenko, since I listen to thoir SuperDataScience podcast (which I love) and I have been enrolled in one of their courses previously and they were really good (in my opinion), but this one feels so shallow, don't get me wrong, it's explained in a way many people can understand without a super background on mathematics or computer science, but it lacks on awe-inspiring content. The paper was also really well written, not to technical not too casual with some examples that anyone can understand.

## Day 8, Jan 8th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Worked a lot on trial and error, simulations and mostly exploration of the tools Signavio, BIMP and Simod, in order to comprehend what the programs are doing and analizing the data outputs by the given inputs.

**Thoughts**: Business Process Modeling is a hot topic in Europe, mostly in research universities and being part of many PhD students, I'm currently working with one PhD professor and indirectly with other 3 located in different parts of the world, so this is going to be very enriched learning.

## Day 9, Jan 9th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Worked with my professor from research developing a mxml to xes parser in Java (repo will be available tomorrow) in order to start creating 'pipelines' from Signavio to Simod and verifying everything works correctly to start adding functionalities to Simod in a forked repository. Full description of Deep Q-Learning (Q-Learning + ANN) on the Udemy course, covering topics like learning, acting, experience replay and action selection policies (epsilon greedy, epsilon soft, softmax).

**Thoughts**: Didn't remember how powerfull is java, specially on older formats of data, we worked with .jar libraries that helped us a lot, but finding them was kinda tricky, since we had to "scrap" a little bit into OpenXES and other websites to get the right compatible library.

## Day 10, Jan 10th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Worked many hours trying to figure out how the notebook works and find why it does not work with other inputs rather than the provided. At the end, slight modifications where done and from now on, my forked repository will be the one I will be working on.

**Thoughts**: Reading other people's code (even Python) can be tricky if not documented properly, my goal is to document any progress I do and eventually, document the previous work done.

## Day 11, Jan 11th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Watched many hours of tutorials on Adobe XD to improve my prototyping/sketching and UI/UX notions on web.

**Thoughts**: It's a super nice to use tool, It's a shame it is not available for Ubuntu (my main OS), fortunately I have a Windows laptop so I can learn it and use it. It really feels like a drag and drop website builder, wish I had learnt this before.

## Day 12, Jan 12th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Operator overloading theory,overloading asingment operator (copy and move), overloading operators as member functions, overloading operators as global functions and overloading the stream insertion and extraction operators.

**Thoughts**: Wow, I think this is some next level C++, it's actually not a thing that one will normally use in a program, it has specific use cases and definetly comes in worthy in large scale projects. I find very interesting to overload "native" functionalities from a language to do whatever you want to do (as long as it keeps it's arity).

## Day 13, Jan 13th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Inheritance concept, terminology and notation, composition, deriving classes, protected members and class access, constructors and destructors (super constructors).

**Thoughts**: This looks like some serious OOP advantage over common procedural programming. I'm currently thinking of learning some Qt for C++ UI and build something great that uses everything I've learnt so far, but, I want to finish this course first and then learn the basics of Qt while building something nice.

## Day 14, Jan 14th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Keeping up with inheritance...passing arguments to base class constructos, copy/move constructos and operator '=' with derived classes, redefinig bases class methods (kinda like 'overloading', where the same name does other thing), multiple inheritance (just scratched the surface of the concept, no work done on this secction).

**Thoughts**: Multiple inheritance looks amazing, I'm eager to learn more aboout it, I'm honestly dissapointed the course does not cover it well, but at least it developed curiosity in me to learn more about that topic, seems more tedious (higher levels of abstraction, maybe things will be way too general to make it work) than complex to implement it.

## Day 15, Jan 15th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Back to AI, onto Deep Q-Learning, starting the process of the environment design, using kivy for the UI, defining initial states on the goal from the starting point. The environment consist of a car trying to reach a corner startring from the opposite corner, the 'lane' consists of a non-straigth path sorrounded by sand, where it 'slows' the car and gives penalty to the AI. The car has angle and rotation properties to properly turn to reach the goal, it has 3 sensors, that detects objects in the front, the left and the right, as well as 3 signals that are triggered by them. It also has many functions that update the movility given the last state and the environment, choosing the best option given by the AI. I penalyzes hitting on walls (edge of map) and it's countered by the sensors and updating the direction of the car (since it can only go forward). The penalty of hitting walls and drive away from the wall are the heaviest, while doing some progress it's a tenth of positive reward equivalent to the worst penalty. The main libraries for the AI is (obviously) numpy and pytorch. The Network class inherits from the pytorch Neural Network implementation, the input layer will be determined by the input_size parameter, as well ad the output neurons determined by the nb_action parameter, the full connections is the pytorch NN are fully connected by the Linear constructor giving the output of a Neural Network input(5) -> 30 hidden -> 30 hidden -> output(3). The forward function (for forward propagation) works on the state given by the environment, by using a rectifier function (RELU) to activate the neurons on the first hidden layer and getting the q values from the second hidden layer with the previous activations. Last but not least, the experience replay implemented as a class, constructed by the last 100 transitions memory space and the memory (list of events).

**Thoughts**: A 'environmentless' model will make the car act like a mad insect, just roaming around without directions (except from avoid the borders), it is reduced to a mere random movement. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch makes AI so much easier to implement, just import it, create it and use it.

## Day 16, Jan 16th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Implementation the 'queue-like' functionality on the ReplayMemory, alongside with the random memory access to get a batch-sized sample to map them into pytorch variables. For the creation of the model class (Deep Q-Learning) some initializations are required from the previous classes, and a gamma variable that is used to discount the reward as the time passes (the more actions the model does the lower the reward will be) and the creation of the Adam optimized binded to the model (Pytorch NN) with a learning rate of 0.001 and a memory (ReplayMemory) with a capacity of a hundred thousand. Using softmax and multinomial functions we are able to not always choose the best action, and do some exploration, the Temperature variable is set to 7 to ensure it acts more 'car-like' than 'insect-like', of course with the highest probability of choosing the best option. The learn is where all of the Q-Learning math happens, starting with outputs calculation given the batch state, predicting the next outputs with the highest q value, calculating our target with the previuosly defined gamma value, using the smooth_l1_loss to calculate our temporal difference, reset our optimized, perform a backpropagation and the using the optimizer to update the weights of the Neural Network.

**Thoughts**: Felt like a 0-60 in 3.6 seconds, really interesting how pytorch interacts with it's own variables and functions, I think is handcrafted with love and passion and thus making an output of a _great_ library, I'm really happy with the progress and what I am learning, with this code, feels like all the theory behind is really being applied in here.
