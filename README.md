# 100DaysOfCodeJournal

In this repository I will document the progress, results and outputs of this challenge I'm making.  
My minimum goal is to finish the challenge without skipping a day and the upgrade it to 365 days of code.  
Documented thing will be a wide range of activities, including but not limited to reading, tutorials,
university assingments, side projects, work, problem solving, research and everything related to coding I do.

## Day 1:

**Today's Progress**: pointer's declaration, access, storage, dereference, arithmetic, also dynamic memory allocation and  
passing pointers to functions, returning pointers from functions, references, L and R-values in C++.  
Gulp JS crash course including moving and copying files, concatenating files, minify (uglyfy) files, and optimize images.

**Thoughts**: I've been learnign C++ lately and it feels so powerful, yet, kinda simple to use, since I really learned how to code in C, it feels
quite familiar, however there are some importante differences I will encounter lately. Pointers look really low level, since it's kind of interacting
with hardware, it gives me the sensation of power and control of what I want to do, it's really interesting. Gulp is a handy tool, a nice understanding
of what I can do to enhance workflows, I don't it's a _MUST_ in the knowledge baggage, but sure it won't hurt to learn a little bit deeper.
